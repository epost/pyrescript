# PyreScript

It's a Python backend for PureScript!

Inspired by [Purescript-to-Python][1].

Very Alpha software here!

## Installation

You'll need [stack][2].

After installing [stack][2]. You should be able to:

```
stack build
```

## Usage

Assuming all went well you can start compiling files.

```
stack exec pysc <FILE>
```

Not much to currently see, but it will compile a simple file like:

```purescript
module Foo where

infixl 4 wat as +

wat :: forall a b. a -> b -> a
wat x _ =  x

foo :: Int
foo = 1 + 2

bar :: Boolean
bar = true

baz :: Boolean
baz = false
```

to a file like:

```python
# Generated by pysc version 0.9.1.0

wat = lambda x:     lambda v:         x
foo = wat(1)(2)
baz = False
bar = True
__all__ = [ "bar", "baz", "foo", "wat" ]
```

Based on that output, there's clearly lots of work to actually be done :).

The file structure looks like:

```
output
└── Foo
    ├── externs.json
    └── __init__.py
```

So, you should be able to fire up a python interpreter and use the compiled file:

```

In [5]: output.Foo.wat([1,2,3])(None)
Out[5]: [1, 2, 3]
